## Project Motivation
For this project, our goal is to conduct exploratory data analysis into Rurby sport. Due to an evolution from amateur to professional level, the game has changed significantly.
Using a dataset from [Rugby 6 Nation Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/cianmcgovernleahy/six-nations-historical-data/version/1) found on Kaggle, our goal is to test if old stereotypes are still true.

Those stereotypes are often related to a game aspect and some player position on the field  :
On physical aspects :
- "Forward" players are bigger than than "Back" players.
- "Props" have the biggest BMI (ratio height/weight).
- "Locks" are taller.

On defensive aspects :
- "Forward" players tackle more than "Back" players.Â 
- "Flankers" are the best tackler in the field. Locks are second".

On offensive aspects :
- "Back" players score more tries than "Forward" players.
- "Wingers" are the best scorer in the game.

On Kicks aspect :
- "Back" players use more their feet than "Forward" players.
- "Fly-half" is the position where we kick more.

I shared to output of this analysis in a blog post on Medium. I hope it help rugby fan to understand what change or not. And maybe close some debate.
The main conclusion surprised me !

## Files Desciption 
You can find the data used in this projet on the [Kaagle web page here](https://www.kaggle.com/cianmcgovernleahy/six-nations-historical-data/version/1).

Because of size and convinience, you can find only the tab which provide the interessreting data for us in the file named "players-stats-input.xls" in the repository.

The exploratory notebbok is available also in the repository. Insite the notebook you can find the CRISP-DM Process until the final visualisations. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.
